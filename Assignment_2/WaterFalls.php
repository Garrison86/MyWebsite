            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Helmcken Falls - Wells Gray Provincial Park, British Columbia</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">One of the most beautiful waterfalls in Canada, Helmcken Falls are located 
            in the majestic Wells Gray Provincial Park, which was created in part to protect the powerful falls. 
            Tumbling water has gradually created a large canyon at the base of the falls and in the winter frozen 
            spray creates an icy wonderland along the edges. Easily accessible by road, there is a platform available 
            for getting that perfect shot.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">A bit of Canadian waterfall trivia: Despite being named after John Sebastian 
            Helmcken for his role in bringing British Columbia into confederation, the physician passed away without 
            ever visiting the natural wonder.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Athabasca Falls - Jasper National Park, Alberta</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">Athabasca Falls is easily one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Canada, and a 
            jewel in the crown of Alberta's legendary Jasper National Park. Cutting through rock and opening onto 
            sweeping mountain vistas, multiple routes and bridges allow for a variety of viewpoints</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">Before reaching the falls, you'll walk along the magnificent limestone gorge where fast flowing water has 
            carved away smooth formations leaving pretty little crevices and swirling whirlpools. Ranging from milky white to aqua 
            blue, the striking colour of the water changes throughout the year, but is always awe-inspiring.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Pissing Mare Falls - Gros Morne National Park, Newfoundland and Labrador </h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">Pissing Mare Falls may have a funny-sounding name but they're no joke: in fact, they're 
            amongst the highest waterfalls in Canada. Located in the stunning Gros Morne National Park, the falls are only accessible 
            by boat tour and most of the time the pristine area is pretty much left alone. The falls drop into Western Brook Pond, 
            which is actually a fresh water fjord carved out by glaciers thousands of years ago. Towering cliffs covered with emerald 
            green foliage provide a dramatic backdrop to this natural phenomenon, making these falls a site to remember.

            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Shannon Falls - Shannon Falls Provincial Park, British Columbia</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">One of the most beautiful waterfalls in Canada is Shannon Falls, whose 
            tumbling rapids rush over a series of granite cliffs into the Howe Sound and eventually the Pacific 
            Ocean. Easy to access and just two kilometres south of Squamish along the Sea to Sky Highway, 
            getting to these falls is a breeze. Best viewed in the spring or autumn, the falls are only 200 
            metres from the parking lot along a paved path. Once you arrive at the falls, a series of trails 
            and boardwalks allow you to further explore the pretty surroundings. Named after William Shannon, 
            a brick maker who settled in the area in the late 19th century, these falls are the third highest 
            in the province.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Niagara Falls - Niagara Falls, Ontario</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px">Niagara Falls are the most famous waterfalls in Canada—and understandably 
            so. Actually made up of three different falls, the aptly named Horseshoe Falls is the only one located 
            on the Canadian side. Easily accessible and always awe-inspiring, Horseshoe Falls is the most powerful 
            in North America. Receding glaciers formed the falls thousands of years ago and the beautiful green 
            colour is due to dissolved salts and finely ground rock. Multiple viewing options are available 
            including the Hornblower boat cruise. The Hornblower replaced the Maid of Mist tour boat, which 
            operated from 1846-2013 and was North America's oldest tourist attraction. In 2007, the base of the 
            falls was used to portray “World's End” in the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.</p>
